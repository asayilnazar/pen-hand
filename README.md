PEN-HAND DISTINGUISHER 
The Project Pen Hand Distinguisher is a Java-based application that leverages OpenCV for real-time detection and differentiation of pen and hand gestures. Utilizing computer vision techniques, the project captures video input and employs image processing algorithms to identify and track the shape and movement of both the pen and the hand. 

Key features include:
- Gesture Recognition: The system distinguishes between hand movements and pen usage, enabling interactive applications.
- Real-time Processing: Fast image analysis allows for immediate feedback, making it suitable for educational tools or interactive interfaces.
- User-Friendly Interface: A graphical interface in Java allows users to easily view the detection results and adjust settings.

This project demonstrates the integration of machine learning with Java programming and computer vision to create a novel interactive tool.
